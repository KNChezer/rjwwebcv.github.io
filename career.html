              <p class="firstP">
                I began my military career at sixteen when I joined the
                Corps of Royal Engineers. I attended the Army Foundation College, Harrogate,
                and then the Royal School of Military Engineering (RSME). 
                Upon completing my training, I joined 21 Engineer Regiment,
                4 Field Squadron, as a Section Sapper and Mechanical Fitter. 
                I deployed to Afghanistan on Operation Herrick 17 as part of
                4 Mechanised Brigade, providing close engineer support to multiple
                brigade assets across Helmand province.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a successful tour of Afghanistan and a construction tour in Kenya, 
                I returned to the RSME to complete the second part of my trade training. 
                I specialised in maintaining the Corps' vast arsenal of equipment, 
                ranging from small portable powered tools and generators to large 
                plant and earth-moving machinery.  
              </p>

              <p>
                Upon completing my Class 1 training, the British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK)
                employed me in their Royal Engineer Support Team. There, I was in my first supervisory
                role in an acting rank- leading military and civilian fitters in maintaining the
                largest deployed heavy vehicle fleet in the Corps, maintaining the fleet in an
                austere and remote environment with limited support and tight deadlines.
                During this time, I was deputised for three weeks to fill the role of my 
                immediate superior, the senior RE fitter in our department, who was three 
                levels above my rank then. For my efforts, the BATUK Commander awarded me
                their commendation.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I returned to the UK, I was promoted and posted to Kinloss, Scotland. 
                During this time, I was deployed to the Falkland Islands on a Corps-wide
                construction project. I worked within the maintenance element, managing a 
                small team of Sapper fitters to maintain the plant fleet with limited support
                in a remote environment before its eventual move back to the UK.

              <p>
                In my last role before discharge, I oversaw a neglected fleet of deployable generators.
                At this time, I was working towards transitioning into civilian life. Despite this, 
                I didn’t let it impede my professionalism and attitude towards my work. I managed
                to take the fleet from zero to seventy-five per cent availability before handing
                responsibility to my successor.
              </p>
              <p>
                On entering civilian life, I worked as a Service Manager for Rondean Ltd. 
                I led a dedicated team servicing and repairing machine tools for customers
                or onward sales. I relished the opportunity to learn new hands-on skills 
                and the challenge of working with equipment that was new to me and outside
                of my comfort zone.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2020, Harpers Environmental offered me a position as their Logistical Planner
                for their Teesside depot, which I was glad to accept. I worked for two years
                managing and planning the movement of clean-up crews and waste materials for 
                the North East and multiple locations across the UK.

                My time in the Royal Engineers taught me about water and waste treatment 
                and the safe consignment of hazardous waste and chemicals. However, at Harper's, 
                I gained a more profound understanding of the logistical planning and regulatory 
                framework of controlling hazardous substances. 
               </p>
               <p>
                After two years, the birth of my son, and weathering the COVID-19 pandemic, 
                my mental health took a turn for the worst. Unresolved trauma from my time in 
                the military left me unable to cope with the stresses of management, leading 
                me to seek a more “hands-on” job. At the same time, I took care of my mental well-being.

                      I took a position as a Maintenance Technician at Doby Verrolec. 
                      While serving in the maintenance department there, I spearheaded drives
                      to hit planned, preventative maintenance targets, reducing downtime to a minimum. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I also sought new means to improve production lines, including one example
                      where I designed, built and installed a two-point tensioning system below 
                      a main drive motor to put an equal amount of tension on the main drive train 
                      without causing premature wear to both chain and drive sprocket
                    </p>

                      After a year at Doby Verrolec, my wife’s visa was up for renewal. 
                      At the time, the UK economy took a drastic hit, and the two of us 
                      decided that it was in the best interest of our family to migrate 
                      to her native California in the United States.

                        Having settled in the US and obtained the right to seek gainful employment, 
                        I am seeking work within my field that will utilise the vast knowledge, 
                        skills and experience I have gained over my career. I also wish to seek 
                        new challenges and gain new skills in my new adopted country as my family 
                        and I make our new lives here in America.
