        <h2 class="post-title">I Wrote this...</h2>
        <p class="firstP">I am excited to be starting work on a new project. I have started putting together a new website
        to host writing projects and blog posts. Not only will this be my first real test of my new found web development
        skills but hopefully go towards giving my writing ambitions a push forward.</p>
        <p>Although writing for me is a hobby, it is something that I am passionate about and something I want to pursue further.
        I use a pen name because I feel that allows for true freedom of artistic expression and what better way to do it than to
        build and publish my own space to do it.</p>
        <p>This will be ongoing and develop as my skills do as I can take the lessons I'm learning and apply them as I go.
        When all is said and done though, I hope I can actually have something that I'll be proud to put out ther for people to see</p>

        <h2 class="post-title">Hello and Welcome!</h2>
        <p class="firstP">To my online CV. A site that I use to showcase my continuous professional development to potential
        employers. Coded and built from scrach by yours truly, I am contantly working to keep this site as up to date
        as I can to showcase what I can do for your company.</p>
        <p>As the ever changing mosaic of new and disruptive emerging technologies becomes more and more a part of our
        daily lives, computer literacy means more to me than just being able to work Microsoft Office programs. Which is
        I took it upon myself to learn, and continue to learn, as many programming languages as I can. Continuous professional
        development was a value instilled in me during my time in the British Army but as you'll see from this site,
        there is more to me than just my abilities with a computer.</p>
        <p>This space will will be updated as I continuously develop myself and adapt new and exciting skills that will almost
        certainly be an asset to you and your company. Feel free to exlore the website and if you like what you see then
        why not get in touch by clicking the "Contact me" link at the bottom of this page and I'll get back to you as soon as I can
        or download a copy of my CV in a PDF format.</p>
