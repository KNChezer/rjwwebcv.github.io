             These projects are, at least for the time being, soley my own and worked on in my own time.
              I am always working on something and keeping myself busy with projects that I’m interested in and passionate about.
               Feel free to explore these projects that I have or am currently working on.</p>

        <p class="firstP">Although at first glance this may fall under hobbies and interest, it is definitely something
           I am actively pursuing at the moment and very passionate about. Written under a pen name, I have recently completed
            the first draft of the first book in my science fiction series that I haven’t come up with a complete title for yet.
             Based hundreds of years in the future set to the backdrop of humanity on the brink of extinction,
             I’m hoping to complete the second and final draft soon and look at publishing or even self publishing options.</p>

        <p class="firstP">Having registered the domain name for wheatleywebdev.com, both myself and my wife are aiming to begin
           freelance web development. Building the foundations of the website itself and gaining experience in full stack web
            development with personal sandbox projects and website builds for family, friends and a few small businesses.
             It is my hope to have it up and running and ready for clients before the year is out.</p>
