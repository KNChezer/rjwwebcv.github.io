        <h2 class="post-title">Hello and Welcome!</h2>
        <p class="firstP">To my online CV. A site that I use to showcase my continuous professional development to potential
        employers. Coded and built from scrach by yours truly, I am contantly working to keep this site as up to date
        as I can to showcase what I can do for your company.</p>
        <p>As the ever changing mosaic of new and disruptive emerging technologies becomes more and more a part of our
        daily lives, computer literacy means more to me than just being able to work Microsoft Office programs. Which is
        I took it upon myself to learn, and continue to learn, as many programming languages as I can. Continuous professional
        development was a value instilled in me during my time in the British Army but as you'll see from this site,
        there is more to me than just my abilities with a computer.</p>
        <p>This space will will be updated as I continuously develop myself and adapt new and exciting skills that will almost
        certainly be an asset to you and your company. Feel free to exlore the website and if you like what you see then
        why not get in touch by clicking the "Contact me" link at the bottom of this page and I'll get back to you as soon as I can
        or download a copy of my CV in a PDF format.</p>
