        <p class="hobbies-post">Both myself and my wife are extremely outdoors people and experienced mountaineers.
         I have climbed mountains in California, the UK and Mount Kenya in Kenya.
          Together we have climbed a number of Munros during our time in Scotland.
          I am a keen writer and have drafted my first novel. I play guitar and sing, perform in local pubs and clubs
           at open mic and jam nights with popular songs as well as some that I have written myself.
            I am also keen to get back into sports that I enjoyed in the army such as skiing, SCUBA diving and
            skydiving when weather, time and money permit.</p>
