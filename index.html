          <h2 class="post-title">Quick Quoter</h2>
          <p class="firstP">I have recently complete my first solo project in pure JavaScript coding. A quick quoting application that will make giving estimate
            prices over the phone much easier. What was initially meant to be a quick practice, quickyl grew into something that I could make user friendly and accesible
            to anyone within the company to use. This was my first attempt at using nothing but reference libraries for refreshing my knowledge while limiting myself 
            to not looking up specifics on how to do certain things within JavaScript. Source code to follow (with sensitive company information removed)</p>

          <p class="firstP">I've started working on a website for a family members buisness. A website for them to showcase their handmade Creations
            and as my skills improve, hopefully some functionality to allow for some direct sales to customers who want to buy their products.
            you can check out the progress so far <a href="https://knchezer.github.io/diversecreations.github.io/">here</a></p>

          <p class="firstP">I've gotten myself a domain name and I've spent some time making improvements to the site in terms of navigation and mobile device

              <h2 class="post-title">I Wrote this...</h2>
              <p class="firstP">I am excited to be starting work on a new project. I have started putting together a new website
                to host writing projects and blog posts. Not only will this be my first real test of my new found web development
                skills but hopefully go towards giving my writing ambitions a push forward.</p>
              <p>Although writing for me is a hobby, it is something that I am passionate about and something I want to pursue further.
                I use a pen name because I feel that allows for true freedom of artistic expression and what better way to do it than to
                build and publish my own space to do it.</p>
              <p>This will be ongoing and develop as my skills do as I can take the lessons I'm learning and apply them as I go.
                When all is said and done though, I hope I can actually have something that I'll be proud to put out ther for people to see</p>

              <h2 class="post-title">Hello and Welcome!</h2>
              <p class="firstP">To my online CV. A site that I use to showcase my continuous professional development to potential
                employers. Coded and built from scrach by yours truly, I am contantly working to keep this site as up to date
                as I can to showcase what I can do for your company.</p>
              <p>As the ever changing mosaic of new and disruptive emerging technologies becomes more and more a part of our
                daily lives, computer literacy means more to me than just being able to work Microsoft Office programs. Which is
                I took it upon myself to learn, and continue to learn, as many programming languages as I can. Continuous professional
                development was a value instilled in me during my time in the British Army but as you'll see from this site,
                there is more to me than just my abilities with a computer.</p>
              <p>This space will will be updated as I continuously develop myself and adapt new and exciting skills that will almost
                certainly be an asset to you and your company. Feel free to exlore the website and if you like what you see then
                why not get in touch by clicking the "Contact me" link at the bottom of this page and I'll get back to you as soon as I can
                or download a copy of my CV in a PDF format.</p>
